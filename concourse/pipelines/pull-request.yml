# This pipeline "header" defines a pipeline which will build and test a Tracim pull-request.
# It requires a ((github-webhook-token)) and a ((github-access-torken)) variables when used.
# It should be concatenated with "build-jobs.yml" to produce a complete pipeline.

#    run frontend (lint + unit tests) checks
#    run end-to-end (cypress) checks

# Each check has its own status in the github's PR.

# Shared jobs definition
# can be included/appended in a complete pipeline definition.
# It must have access to:
# 1. Tracim sources through a "tracim-source" resource
# 2. Test container image through a "test-image" resource
# 3. Github status notifications called with YAML anchors:
#    - "status_notifications" (on_success/â€¦)
#    - "pending_status_notification" job.
# 4. a "reconfigure-self" job which takes care of updating the full pipeline
